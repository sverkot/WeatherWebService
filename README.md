# WeatherWebService
Android Mobile WebService Project using Weather API and Android WebView

Project description
--------------------
First, create a version of your web service project with separate pages that have no navigation bars, 
similar to what I did with the Weather application.  
Next, create an Android application with a launch screen that provides an introduction to 
your application and allows the user to launch any of the pages in your web application using a 
WebView (not an implicit intent). This screen can use buttons, spinners or any component that 
you think is attractive and user friendly.
